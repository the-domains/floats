Introduction 
This learning log is the outcome of following a course in Innovation and Change Management on the 2

nd
semester of a 

Master study called Operations and Innovation management. The learning log will include background on me, my 
expectations for the course, goals set for myself to achieve throughout the course and description and reflections 
from each of the lectures. The learning log will be divided into three deliveries throughout the semester. 

The structure of the Learning log is:

Personal Background: 
My Background: 

- Bachelor in Global Business Engineering 
- 2 years of Software engineering 

From my educational background I have been working with a set of different topics. The focus has been on problem 
based learning where each semester has been conducted in close collaboration with a case company faced with a real 
problem. 

My (work) Experience: 
- Cubic 
- Energi Nord 
- HEF Fibernet 
- Student Assistant Aalborg University 
- Semester projects 
- Case competition Accenture 
- Start-up company with two friends (still in progress) 
- www.PacketGeneral.com 

Through both work and education I have worked with real organisational problems. Both in relation to my part-time 
jobs and semester projects I have been able to use what I have learned into solutions and models applicable for 
companies. Both in the case competition at Accenture and in my part-time jobs I have been able to use the PBL 
approach. 

My overall expectations for the course: 
My expectations for the course is to get an understanding of the terms Innovation and Change Management, as well 
as gain new knowledge about methods, tools and approaches for leading innovation and change in organisations. As 
globalisation recent years has intensified competition from all over the world the dynamics of business environments 
has increased. The increased dynamics and uncertainty of the environment entails that companies should be ready to 
change and be on the forefront of innovation to remain competitive. As the Innovation and Change management 
topic's importance is increasing I hope that tools and methods presented in the course will allow me to successfully 
acquire a foundation for successful leading of innovation and change in my future business life. 

I have setup a set of initial goals that I hope to realise throughout the semester. The goals are both personal as well as 
educational. The goals listed beneath have relation to what I want to achieve from the Innovation and Change 
Management course. 

1\. Find out what Innovation is and what it really means for companies 
2\. Find out what drivers that exist for innovation 
3\. Find out if change and innovation is a one-time event or if it is a continuous process 
4\. How to manage innovation in SMEs as well as MNEs 

Additional learning objectives may be specified throughout the course, as new knowledge can spur of new questions. 
New learning objectives will be described in the reflection part of a lecture and hopefully be answered throughout the 
course.

Lecture 1: Introduction 
The first lecture was mainly about setting the stage for the rest of the course. It furthermore included introduction to 
change arenas. The lecture was held by Astrid and Frank. 

Lecture 1: Review 
In order to uncover where and why change in organisations happen the focus of this lecture was to identify possible 
change arenas as well as pressures that lead to change. Furthermore, the lecture presented different ways of seeing 
change. It was made clear that there is a relation between innovation and change in the sense that when innovation 
happens it implies that change is necessary. On the other hand change is a necessity for innovation to happen. 
Furthermore, change can happen without an innovation has been made, but innovation always implies change. The 
term innovation was argued to be a fuzzy concept. Thus, companies should make their own decision on how they 
understand innovation in relation to how it fits their environment, because all persons have different perceptions on 
how it is used and how to be understood. 

To identify where change might happen in relation to an organisation different models were presented. Both internal 
and external pressures which might require organisations to change exist. It was presented that change arenas can be 
related to internal aspects of an organisation -- e.g. when going from one organisational structure to another 
(Mintzberg's organisational structures and life-cycle of an organisation), the external environment -- e.g. when 
elements of the industry changes (when forces in the competitive environment changes (Porter's five forces)) and in 
the supply chain (when the network the company is in changes). 
Three distinctive views on how the change process can be regarded were presented. First, the change process can be 
regarded as a sequential process; going from having an idea through a set of processes to achieve success. Change can 
also be inflicted by forces (both internally and externally). The forces create a need for change in the organisation 
which will result in initiating change and finally implementing the change. The last, and the reality, model is that the 
change process is regarded as a big spider-web of different drivers for change. In order to try to make sense of the 
dynamics of change in organisations McKinsey's 7s model was presented as a tool to assess and monitor change. 

Figure 1: McKinsey's 7s model 

McKinsey's 7s model is a tool to focus on the areas where change due to an innovation typically happens (or should 
happen) in an organisation. Depending on the type of innovation there can be a necessity for change e.g. the structure 
of the organisation as well as the necessary skills within the organisation. Furthermore, it was stressed in the course 
that the soft skills are very important when considering innovations and change. 

It was stressed that there is a clear distinction between invention and innovation. Inventions are when something new 
is developed. However it is not an innovation until the invention is put in context and adapted to the environment. 
This includes changing the environment to accept the invention and to realise the potential value of the invention. 
Disruptive innovation has some distinctive features that distinctions it from e.g. radical and breakthrough innovations. 
Radical innovation tends to be related to technical innovation but is however used interchangeable. Disruptive

Innovation is defined by markets and competition and is used when markets are undermined by new innovations. 
Breakthrough innovations make great improvements, but are not undermining the markets, and the competition. 

Briefly the 4 P's of innovation model was introduced (cf. Figure 2). This is a model to see that innovation can happen 
within the space of the 4 P's (Product, process, paradigm and position) and it can all be either incremental or radical. 

Figure 2: 4 Ps of innovation 

Definition of innovation = the successful exploitation of new ideas. However, for a company to successfully be 
innovative, it has to go through a set of stages. These are the four generic stages of Search, Select, Implement and 
Capture (cf. Figure 3). Each stage however includes a set of decisions and activities to be performed. This model will 
be explained further in the following lectures. 

Lecture 1: Discussion 
The topics learned in today's lecture can be related to the course of Organisational analysis and Design where a great 
deal of focus was put in Mintzberg's organisational structures. When an organisation evolves and grows it typically 
goes through a set of organisational changes (Mintzberg, Quinn, & Ghoshal, 1998). This implies that change in the 
organisation is actually implemented. The importance of the soft issues in an organisation was underpinned. 

"At least 70% of major corporate changes fail to capture the benefits ascribed to them. A big factor is that the soft 
issues are not understood to truly be the hard issues. Not enough attention is dedicated to the hearts and minds of the 

people in the organisation" (United airlines Glenn Tilton). 

This can be related to take-aways from the course of design thinking, where designing solutions start out with a focus 
on the human perspective. So when designing solutions you are first of all looking towards the "customers" of the 
innovation, which means that it should be desirable for the people who are going to use the innovation. The 
involvement of stakeholders is important in order to make the stakeholders buy-in on the innovation. Changes 
necessary to exploit the value of an innovation will be difficult if you do not have the support from the stakeholders, 
and the chance of failure is high. With always having the human perspective in mind, you will be able to create viable 
and feasible solutions that are desirable for the users. Different tools such as Future workshops and Design Thinking 
(both from the EED course) can be used to facilitate involvement of the stakeholders in the innovation process which 
can help ease the change process (Weisbord, 1992). This can further be related to Christensen et al.'s (2003) fourth 
key point about not trying to change customers' behaviour but designing the product so that it will satisfy the users 
who is going to use it (Christensen, Raynor, & Anthony, 2003). 

In relation to McKinsey's 7s model I see the usability in seeing how the different elements of an organisation interact 
with each other. The tool can be used to evaluate if alignment between the seven areas is achieved, or if there is a

need for change. This model can be related to the Operations Strategy Matrix, a tool from Operations Development 
and Design, which can be used to evaluate (or devise) the operational strategy of the organisation (Slack & Lewis, 
2011). The tools are used, on different levels of the organisation, to align requirements from the environment with 
the capabilities of the organisation and to identify elements where alignment is not achieved and that there is a need 
for change. 

The fact that change cannot be seen as a sequential process but in reality is one big spider-web of forces pushing or 
pulling towards change makes it necessary for companies to remain agile in order to be able to make continuous 
innovation. The fact that there is a constant flux in the environment, and increased dynamics due to e.g. globalisation, 
it is necessary for companies not only to easily acquire new knowledge, but also to un-learn knowledge and 
capabilities no longer necessary. This is a difficult task for companies. 

The 4P's of innovation can be set in relation to the Product Life cycle as different stages in a products life cycle will 
tend to have focus on different elements of innovation. E.g in the introduction phase of the PLC curve there will be a 
focus on product innovation until the market settles on a platform and starts to grow and become mature. The more 
mature the market gets the more focus there will be on process innovation as the economies of scale now will be a
